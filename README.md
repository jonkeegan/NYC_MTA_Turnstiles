Some tools to help working with New York City's Metropolitan Transit Authority turnstile data.

You can find this data published weekly here:
http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html

Data formatting is described here:
http://www.mta.info/developers/resources/nyct/turnstile/ts_Field%20Description.txt

MTA_TURNSTILES.sql is a SQL file that will create a new table with the correct column counts, 
and field names. Tihs is meant to be quick and dirty, so all cols are currently set as varchar(255).

It also includes some sample data to get going.
